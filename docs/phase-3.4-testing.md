## Phase 3.4 testing – Business profile + service catalogue

This feature is org-scoped. Set an org id via the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_ORG_ID` (defaults to `demo-org` on the server).

### Steps
1) Navigate to `/catalog/business` and fill out the business profile. Save to persist brand, positioning, and standard terms.
2) Visit `/catalog/services` and create a new service suite. Provide a pricing model plus optional deliverables, milestones, and discovery questions.
3) Open a service suite and click **Seed proposal** to generate a draft proposal. Enter a custom title if desired.
4) Open `/proposals/[id]/preview` for the new record and confirm the content includes positioning, deliverables, milestones, pricing, and terms derived from the catalogue.
